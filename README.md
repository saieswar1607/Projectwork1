## Results and Impact
<!--Give the results and impact as shown below-->
our Custom Itinerary Planner are designed to thoroughly validate the system’sfunctionality across various modules, including user registration, login, itinerary creation,
personalized recommendations, and payment processing. These tests ensure that the systemmeets both functional and non-functional requirements, providing a seamless and user-friendly experience. By conducting comprehensive tests like black box testing, boundary value testing, and UI testing, we can identify potential issues early on and address them before deployment. The successful execution of these test cases guarantees that the application will be robust, secure, and capable of offering customized travel planning solutions to users, thereby enhancing overall satisfaction and performance.
